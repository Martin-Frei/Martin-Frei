- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martin-Frei
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that catches my curiosity. Right now, that’s Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 🌱 Currently learning Python and HTML/CSS. Next up: JavaScript, Django and that SQL Stuff. In a year, I aim to master EDA, ML, and Deep Learning.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate with like-minded people—learning together and applying knowledge in real-world projects.
- 📫 Reach me on GitHub or meet me in person—I'm based 10 km north of Rosenheim. Coffee’s always free! ☕
- 😄 Pronoun: Quiet thinker, sharp problem solver, always curious, and up for a good technical debate.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Bachelor in Meat Processing, used to purchase €120K–180K of meat per week, Paramedic in 2013, Mine Diver in the Navy (1995), passionate cook (mostly Bavarian cuisine)—always up for a good meal and a great conversation!.
